// A stand-in for Claude Code in end-to-end tests: Hive launches it through its real Claude Code adapter
// (Settings → Claude Code → path = fake-claude.cmd), so the launch, hooks, status, transcripts and the Agent API
// are tested without signing in or spending tokens. It must run with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR pointing at a test folder.
//
// What it does, like Claude Code:
// - `--version` and `auth status --json` answer as a signed-in CLI. `--version` says 2.1.999, or the version in
//   fake-version.txt in CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when there is one (#698: a CLI updated between launches).
// - In a folder it hasn't been told to trust, it first asks "Do you trust this folder?" with Claude Code's menu, but
//   starting on "Yes, I trust this folder" (Claude Code's starts on "No, exit"), so Enter trusts it; Down/Up move the
//   choice, and Enter on "No, exit" quits (exit 1).
// - It sends SessionStart, then takes prompts: the last command-line argument, or a line typed and sent with
//   Enter (Ctrl+U clears the line), shown on its input line as it is typed. With fake-launch-hold-<agent> in its home, it
//   holds its command line's task after SessionStart until the test makes fake-launch-go-<agent> (#712: a CLI ready but
//   not yet on its task). Each prompt sends UserPromptSubmit, is written to the transcript, "works"
//   (1 s, or N seconds for "work N"), and ends with a reply and Stop. "newfield": its UserPromptSubmit carries a
//   top-level field Claude Code doesn't send (hive_test_new_field: true), as a CLI update adding one would (#698). "edit <file>" first sends PreToolUse for
//   an Edit of that file and records the tool call. "background N" starts a background command that ends after
//   N seconds; its task notification then starts a turn by itself, as in Claude Code. "pad N" adds N KB to the
//   transcript. "context N": the reply's request reports N input tokens, so the session's context is about N. "ask" first asks for permission (a permission_prompt Notification), then carries on by itself.
//   "holduntil NAME": the turn doesn't end until the test makes a file NAME in its home (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR).
//   "askwhen NAME": the permission prompt once the test makes a file NAME in its home (#667), not after a set time.
//   "waitfile NAME" as a step ("waitfile go then hive hive_inbox {}"): the steps after it wait for that file.
//   "shell: <command line>" runs a command in cmd with the session's environment (fake-shell.jsonl records it).
//   "linger N" leaves N processes running after it ends, as an agent's preview server or tail -f does (#507): each a
//   detached, hidden node started by a short-lived detached one that has exited by then (linger.cjs; their pids in
//   fake-linger.jsonl in its home; each ends by itself after two minutes, in case). With fake-linger-at-start.txt (N) in
//   its home, it leaves N the moment it starts, before anything else. "progress-linger" leaves a command running
//   through the session's hive-progress shim, as a Codex agent once did (#542): cmd → hive-progress → a lingering node
//   (linger.cjs; its pid in fake-progress-linger.jsonl in its home), and ends its turn without waiting for it.
//   "devapp" leaves a dev copy of an Electron app running, as an agent's dev launch of Hive did (#614): Electron's
//   executable with Playwright's --inspect=0 --remote-debugging-port=0 and a copy of devapp in its home (a hidden window; quits after two
//   minutes, in case), started through a detached node that exits at once (linger.cjs); its pid in fake-devapp.jsonl.
//   "boardmove N COLUMN" moves card N as hive_update_task does (the hive tools' API, token and agent, from
//   --mcp-config) and records the answer in fake-calls.jsonl; "boardreview N ACTION [COLUMN]" reviews it the same way
//   (review: start, passed or failed; a column with the verdict), and "boardcomment N" comments on it. All are written to the transcript as the hive tool
//   call they stand for (mcp__hive__hive_update_task), as Claude Code writes an MCP call. "hive TOOL {json}" calls a
//   hive tool through the real hive MCP server of the launch's --mcp-config (fake-bridge.cjs: logged and measured by
//   Hive's performance metrics as a real call is), written to the transcript as that MCP call and its reply. Hive's
//   doorbell ("[Hive] New in your inbox: …", #650) it follows as a model does: it reads its inbox with hive_inbox (and
//   acks it too when it follows notices, below). New work (a task, a handover) it read is its prompt; what else it read
//   (a card watch's wake, "[Hive] #12 is in Review…", a message), like a line Hive types to wake it, is logged in
//   fake-wakes.jsonl (with `enter`: which Enter since the line was begun sent it, 1 for the first, #664) and answered
//   with the next line of fake-wakes-<agent>.txt (a test's script of what this agent does next); with a number N in
//   fake-drop-enters-<agent>.txt, it drops the next N Enters after such a line, which stays typed (#376). It turns on
//   bracketed paste, as Claude Code does. While fake-slow-input-<agent>.txt is in its home it reads no input, as a busy
//   Claude Code (#597; fake-slow-input-<agent>.paused says it has stopped): what arrived meanwhile comes in one read,
//   taken as Claude Code 2.1.296 takes one that isn't a bracketed paste: a paste, in which a Ctrl+U or an Enter is
//   kept as text (not sent), and after which the next Enter is lost too. "skill NAME" reads a skill
//   as Claude Code's Skill tool does: a Skill call in the transcript ("hive:NAME"), answered with the skill's SKILL.md
//   from the launch's plugin folder (an error when it has none).
// - "/compact [focus]" compacts as Claude Code does: PreCompact, a compaction boundary in the transcript after 1 s (N
//   seconds when the focus has "hold N"), then PostCompact. With no messages yet it says "Not enough messages to compact."
//   and sends no hook; with "compactfail" in the focus it fails after PreCompact with "Error during compaction". A
//   compaction that worked sends SessionStart (compact) before PostCompact, as Claude Code does. The context Hive gives
//   in a SessionStart reply (#1032: the Assistant's state view) is logged in fake-start-context.jsonl.
// - Idle, as Claude Code 2.1.296 is (#612): with fake-idle-notify.txt (N) in its home, N ms after a turn ends with no
//   input since, it sends the Notification "Claude is waiting for your input" (idle_prompt) once, as Claude Code does a
//   minute after a turn. A prompt with "loststop" ends its turn without a Stop reaching Hive, as one of HB3's did. When
//   the test makes fake-idle-compact-<agent> in its home, it compacts while idle as Claude Code does before the prompt
//   cache expires: PreCompact (auto), a compaction boundary, and once the test makes fake-idle-compact-done-<agent>,
//   SessionStart (compact), PostCompact (auto) and "Compacted while idle, before the prompt cache expired";
//   fake-recap-<agent> makes it write a recap (an away_summary), which sends no hook of Hive's. Each file is taken
//   (removed) when acted on.
// - Turns, as Claude Code 2.1.296 has them (#648): each prompt (and each turn it begins by itself) has its own id, which
//   its hooks carry (prompt_id); its screen shows a spinner with "esc to interrupt" while it works and "✻ Worked for Ns ·
//   done H:MM" above its input once done. "latetool": a Read whose PostToolUse reaches Hive after the turn's Stop.
//   "stopcontinue": after its Stop, once the test makes fake-continue-<agent>, it goes on as when another Stop hook
//   blocks: a tool call in the same turn (held until fake-continue-done-<agent>), then Stop with stop_hook_active.
// - Safeguards, as Claude Code 2.1.296 records them (#606): "safeguard" runs a Bash call, then its safety classifier
//   stops the response: the system note ("…'s safeguards stopped the response above · continuing once with that noted")
//   and, the next entry in its chain, the notice for the model (a user entry with refusedMessageId), and it carries on
//   once. With "fallback" it then runs on Opus 4.8 by itself (claude-opus-4-8), as with /config's model switch on.
//   "safeguardprompt": after its turn's Stop it asks whether to switch models (its question dialog, "Model switch", with
//   the choices "1. Switch automatically" and "2. Stay on …"), drawn on a cleared screen, and a permission_prompt
//   Notification ("Claude needs your permission"); an Enter answers it (the screen cleared again, its input back, no
//   hook), and the idle notification follows as after a turn. Answered so, it stays on its model and records nothing
//   (as HB3's stop); "safeguardpromptswitch" is answered "Switch automatically": its record of the flagged request
//   (model_refusal_fallback, for the session) and the model it switched to (Opus 4.8, or Sonnet 5.5 if on Opus 4.8).
// - Notices (#650), as Claude Code 2.1.296 takes them: context in a PostToolUse or Stop reply reaches "the model", and a
//   Stop answered with context (or a block) carries the turn on to another Stop with stop_hook_active. Each notice
//   ("[Hive] …") is logged in fake-notices.jsonl (agent, where, text). With fake-follow-notices.txt in its home (any
//   agent) or fake-follow-notices-<agent>.txt, it acts on one as a model that follows Hive's notices: hive_inbox, then
//   hive_inbox with ack for the ids it listed. "checkpoint" as a step is a tool call (a Bash, PreToolUse and PostToolUse)
//   whose PostToolUse reply it reads.
// - `--name` and "/rename <name>" set the session's name in the transcript (a custom title), as Claude Code does. With
//   fake-title-untimed-<agent> in its home (taken at launch), --name's title line has no timestamp, so a resumed old
//   session keeps its last activity until its next turn (#895).
// - Its system prompt (the --append-system-prompt-file's text) is recorded on a conversation's first request and that
//   record used on every later one and every resume, as Claude Code does since 2.1.267, until it compacts;
//   `--system-prompt-snapshot off` uses the file's text each time instead (#334). A prompt with "whatmode" says the
//   mode its system prompt is in ("# Your mode: <name>", the Hive Assistant's) at the end of its reply. With
//   fake-resume-draw.json ({ "ms": N }) in CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, a resumed session loses each Enter for its first N ms,
//   keeping what was typed, as Claude Code can while it draws a long conversation.
// - Ctrl+C twice, or "/exit", ends it with SessionEnd.
// - With fake-signin.json in CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR saying { "expired": true } (read each time; one test home, so one sign-in
//   for all its agents, #309), it acts out an expired sign-in as Claude Code 2.1.291 does: `auth status --json` says
//   it isn't logged in (indented JSON, exit 1, as 2.1.296 does), and each prompt's turn ends at once with "Login expired · Please run /login" and a StopFailure
//   hook (error authentication_failed) instead of Stop. "/login" typed in it signs in (the file says expired: false)
//   and carries the failed turn on by itself, as Claude Code did: a tool call (PostToolUse), then the reply and Stop.
//   With "atLaunch": true as well, it stops before its session starts, as Claude Code 2.1.296 did with an OAuth session
//   it couldn't refresh: "Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed", exit 1 (#577).
// - `--model fail-start` makes it refuse to start, printing an error and exiting with 1, as Claude Code does for an
//   argument it rejects.
// - `-p --input-format stream-json` answers the Agent SDK's initialize control request with Claude Code 2.1.289's
//   recorded reply (tests/fixtures/claude-initialize.json), as Hive asks for its models (#125); FAKE_CLAUDE_MODELS=fail
//   makes it answer with an error instead. With fake-models.json in CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ({ "haikuAuto": true | false | null },
//   read each time, #234) it acts out a CLI that says Haiku takes Auto, doesn't (as 2.1.289), or says nothing about Auto
//   (no model has supportsAutoMode): asked for Auto with Haiku, it runs in Auto only when it said Haiku takes it, else
//   in Manual, and reports the mode it really runs in. Without the file it runs in the mode it was asked for.
