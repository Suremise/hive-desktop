// Housekeeping for %LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test (#253): what the tests leave behind there is removed once it is no longer
// needed, so the folder stays small without anyone tidying it by hand.
//
//   npm run test:clean                  removes what is stale and prints each area's size
//   npm run test:clean -- --dry-run     lists what it would remove (and what it keeps, and why), removes nothing
//   npm run test:clean -- --days N      the age after which leftovers go (default 3; 0: everything not kept below)
//
// The e2e runner and the scenario runner run the same clean-up when they finish (bounded: autoClean), so nothing piles
// up; `test:clean` is for on-demand use and for the sizes.
//
// What goes:
// - In an idle e2e lane (no runner holds its claim: lanes.mjs; the clean-up claims it while it works, so no runner starts
//   in it meanwhile): every suite folder no run claims (a failed suite's is claimed by its run's logs until KEEP_RUNS
//   prunes them: #285), and anything left from before suites had folders of their own, whatever their age. In an idle
//   scenario lane: numbered copies (`<scenario>-2`…) whatever their age, the rest (what --keep left) by age.
// - In the e2e work folder: anything but `lanes` and `logs` older than the age (suites run on their own, probes).
// - Anything else in hive-test older than the age (one-off folders and files: reviewers' and builders' probes).
//   `scratch\<agent>-<date>` is the place for probes that must be under hive-test: its folders go by the same age.
// - In the Codex test home (#404, codexPlan), under its lease (codexHomeLock.mjs; nothing while a run holds it): rollouts
//   older than the age, package copies Codex no longer runs, and unfinished downloads in its cache older than the age.
// What stays, always:
// - The CLI test homes' sign-ins, config, sandbox setup and databases (`codex`: all but the above; `claude`: never
//   opened); scenario results and baselines; the claims
//   and locks (`e2e-lanes`, `heavy-slots`, `build-locks`), the concurrency checker's folders (it removes its own:
//   tempWorktrees.mjs) and the Progress panel's timings. Logs (`e2e\logs`) are pruned by the runner (logs.mjs).
// - A lane a runner holds.
// - Anything a card that isn't Done (nor archived) cites (evidence.cjs: its path, a path inside it, or a folder it is
//   in), listed as "kept: cited by #n"; once the card is Done, the age rule applies. While the board can't be read (none
//   found up from this repository's main checkout, or a card that can't be read), nothing at all is removed: what is
//   cited can't be known. The same rules hold wherever tests delete their output (evidence.cjs).
// Links (a worktree's node_modules is a junction) are removed as links, never followed.
