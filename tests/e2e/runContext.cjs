// The run context (#203): everything a test run, and each suite in it, has of its own, so runs never assume they are
// alone on the machine or inherit whatever environment they were started from.
//
// - The environment, here: every child a test starts (a suite, a test copy of Hive, the hive MCP server, the
//   hive-progress wrapper) gets an environment built from an allowlist (ALLOW: Windows' own variables, the user's
//   folders, the network's proxy and certificates) plus what the context sets itself (a profile, quiet, ports, the
//   suite's folders, CLI homes). Nothing else from the parent: not the variables of the Hive session it was started
//   from (HIVE_API_TOKEN…, HIVE_PROGRESS_*), not NO_COLOR or FORCE_COLOR, not ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE, not CLAUDE_* or
//   ANTHROPIC_* (the real tier uses the CLIs' own sign-in). Test settings a person may set for a run are passed on by
//   name (PASS_ENV); a new one is added there, with what it is for. tests/e2esuites.test.ts fails for a suite or the
//   scenario harness that builds a child's environment from process.env.
// - The runners' own tools (#208): the runners, lib.cjs and the scenario harness run in the shell they were started
//   from, so the children they start themselves (the build, git, where.exe, taskkill) get baseEnv() too, never what a
//   call without env inherits (GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE would point their git at another repository, NODE_OPTIONS
//   reach the build). The unit test fails for a child_process call there without env. Not a child, the runners'
//   progress reporting (tests/progressReport.mts) keeps reading the shell's Hive variables: it reports to that Hive.
// - Folders: the work folder (WORK: the lane's, which the runner gives each suite as HIVE_E2E_DIR) and the CLI test
//   homes (CODEX_HOME, CLAUDE_TEST_HOME). What a test copy of Hive deletes goes to its trash folder in the suite's
//   (HIVE_TEST_TRASH_DIR, `<work>	rash`, #414), never the user's Recycle Bin, and goes with the suite's folder.
// - Ports and lane folders: lanes.mjs (each runner claims a lane); each suite's port is HIVE_E2E_PORT, from its runner.
// - The build: build.mjs, under a lock per worktree, so runners started together build it once.
// - Load: slots.mjs, at most a few heavy runs at once on the machine (HEAVY_DIR); the others queue.
