// What the tests may delete in %LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test (#253): never what a card that isn't Done cites as evidence,

// (clean.mjs), the e2e runner's suite folders and log pruning (run.mjs, logs.mjs), the scenario runner's lane folders,
// results and baselines (tests/scenarios). Removing never follows a link out (a worktree's node_modules is a junction).
//
// A card cites a path under hive-test by writing it (in its title, description or a comment, any slash and case):
// - the thing itself, ending with at least its folder and name: `e2e\review158-dark.png`, `lanes\0\board\board.png`,
//   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test\evidence`;
// - a path inside a folder keeps the folder: `evidence\x.png` keeps `evidence`, `lanes\0\board\board.png` keeps the
//   suite folder `lanes\0\board` (but not the rest of lane 0);
// - a folder as a whole keeps everything in it: `hive-test\evidence` (ending there) keeps what is in it, and
//   `lanes\0\board\` keeps that suite's folder. Only folders that hold evidence count, not the areas themselves
//   (`hive-test`, `e2e`, `e2e\lanes`, a lane `e2e\lanes\0`, `scratch`…), which cards name when they talk about the
//   tests: a lane is where runs keep their suites' folders, not evidence, and a card naming one kept every folder every
//   later run made in it (#285).
// A name alone isn't a citation: a card listing leftovers to remove names them (`charts-132`), and a folder named like
// a word (`scripts`) would be kept by any path with that word (`scripts/licenses.mjs`). Keeping a little more than
// needed is the safe side.
