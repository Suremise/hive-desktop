// Is the dev build in out/ made from the source as it is now? The runner (run.mjs) asks before running suites, so a run
// record never vouches for code that wasn't built. File times can't say: deleting a source file, or restoring an older
// copy, leaves every remaining file older than the build. So a build made with --build stamps out/ with a hash of
// everything it was made from (the paths and their contents), and a run compares that with the source now. A build
// made another way (npx electron-vite build) has no stamp, so which code it holds is unknown.
//
// Runners started at the same time in one worktree (two agents' checks, an e2e run beside a scenario run) share its
// out/: building it is done under a lock per worktree (#200, #203). The first runner to find the build stale takes the
// lock, looks again, builds once and stamps it; the others wait for the lock, look again, and find it fresh. A runner
// that only checks (no --build) waits while another builds, so it never looks at half a build. Worktrees don't wait
// for each other. A lock whose runner is gone (crashed, killed) is broken by the next one.
