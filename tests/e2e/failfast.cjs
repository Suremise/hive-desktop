// A process that failed to start is reported with its code (#599). Under heavy load Windows can fail a process as it
// starts (0xc0000142: its desktop heap runs short); the runner says the code and what it means, so the agent running the
// tests can react. The failure here is Node made: a child that has started ends with the startup failure's status, so
// nothing unsigned runs and no dialog can show. So this checks the reporting (the code is seen as soon as the child
// ends, and said), not that a real loader failure shows no dialog: under real load one can (windowsExits.cjs). No test
// copy of Hive, no window.
