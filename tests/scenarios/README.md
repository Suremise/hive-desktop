# Scenarios: do agents use Hive's skills and keep its rules?

Hive tells agents little up front (its session contract) and leaves its workflows to skills they load when needed
(#102). These scenarios check that this works. Given what a user would say, does the agent or the Assistant:

- read the right skill;
- make the right hive tool calls;
- leave the board, notes and files as they should be?

They check what happened, never the wording of a reply.

Each scenario (`scenarios.cjs`) sets up a throwaway workspace: cards, handovers, notes, a second project, or a deleted
or edited skill. It starts the project's agent **Coder** or the **Hive Assistant** through Hive's dev build with the
scenario's prompt, waits for its turn to end (and for any agent the Assistant started), and reads only evidence of what
ran:

- **Hive tool calls** come from the hive MCP server itself. In development builds it logs each call it ran, with
  whether it worked, to the file named by `HIVE_TEST_MCP_LOG`. Tool names in a transcript, or in a Codex script that
  may never have run, are kept apart as *mentions* and are never counted as calls.
- **The merge slot** comes from Hive's own record: development builds write each change to the slots (who holds one,
  told so or not, and who waits in line) and each claim or release as Hive resolved it (the branch, and what it did:
  held or in line; released, left the line or nothing), with its time, to the file named by `HIVE_TEST_MERGE_SLOT_LOG`.
  The merge scenarios (#374) set that beside the checks' own runs (check.js records each run's start, with the commit,
  the base, any merge in progress and the tree it checked, and its end with the result) and the merge's moment (a reference-transaction hook
  in the scenario's repository times each branch update to the millisecond). They check that the agent's claim of the
  base's slot held; it held the slot from before the checks that went in (the run that checked exactly the tree the merge
  committed) until they ended passing, and through the
  merge after them; it waited in line behind another holder; and its own release of the base's slot ended that hold
  after the merge, or after its checks ended failing. A hold that ended otherwise (its session's end, the user), a
  release resolved to another branch, or a time that can't be placed doesn't count.
- **Skills read**: a Skill call for the skill that didn't fail, or a read (not a write) of its `SKILL.md` whose result
  is that skill's own text (its `name:` line). Writing to the path, echoing it, or a failed read doesn't count.
- **The board, shared notes and files** afterwards, through the Agent API and `git status`.
- **Whether any Agent API token** (the workspace's, an agent's, or the Assistant's) shows up in a tool's output or a
  reply, checked against the actual token values.
- **Usage and cost** (`session:usage`), the CLI's version, and provenance: the running Hive's guidance and skill
  revisions (`/v1/status`), and the source commit with a fingerprint of uncommitted changes.

The checks are positive and negative:
- **Working on a card**: through Doing to Review, never to Passed or Done.
- **A card in Done** needing more work goes back through Doing to Review.
- **A reviewer** marks the card and keeps it in Review with its implementer, changes no files, and doesn't finish a
  card that went back to Doing under it. **A review that passes** moves the card to Passed with its verdict, not to
  Done.
- **Done means merged**: the builder moves its Passed card to Done once its branch is merged.
- **Card decisions** (#357): a decision the user records while the agent works on the card is flagged in its next board reply, and the agent reads the card again before moving it to Review; a reviewer fails work that ignores one of the card's decisions, also when woken for round 2 with a decision recorded since round 1 (its first reply flags it, and it reads the card in full before its verdict). An agent that asks the user and ends its turn is told of the decision recorded for it (#401), also when it asked about a card in Todo, which it takes first (#438).
- **Merging when the base moved** after the checks (another branch merged meanwhile): the agent merges the base into
  its branch again and reruns the checks on that combination before merging (the fakes do it with real git commands).
- **Handovers**: the latest handover's next step, or the named one's, is done, and the other isn't. A wrap-up writes a
  handover without re-running tests.
- **Notes**: a lasting rule goes to a shared note, while progress goes on the card.
- **A plan** starts nothing.
- **A script against the API** runs with the agent's own token, lists its project's card, is refused for another
  project's, and never prints a token.
- **Ordinary coding** reads no Hive skill.
- **No git worktree of its own** (#476, #482): asked to keep the folder as it is while it tries a change (not asked
  for a worktree), the agent makes none on its own initiative and leaves the folder as it was (Hive sets its folder; an
  agent with its own worktree is the user's to add, and a worktree the user asks for is theirs).
- **Stop what you start** (#613): asked to watch a card's minute-long run for failures as it goes, the agent leaves
  nothing running once the card is in Review. A scenario with `leftovers: true` has the harness stop the session after
  its turn and read what Hive then lists as left running (`session:leftovers` once settled, #507): the processes its
  launch started and left.
- **Scratch outside the project** (#509): a reviewer asked for a probe script and a log of its output leaves the
  project as it was, makes no `.codex` folder in it and adds nothing beside it.
- **Card loops**: at the round limit the builder asks the user. A finding that comes back is another round: the builder
  fixes it without asking, and the reviewer fails it marked as recurring. A finding the builder disputes stops the reviewer
  to ask. A builder fixing a failed card brings it back into Review for round two (also without it leaving Review), so the
  waiting reviewer is woken. A builder woken by one card passing while the other failed at the same moment acts on the
  failed one too. A builder starting a loop registers its lane (the cards in order, its reviewer, rounds and wait) before
  its first card's review; a reviewer joins its builder's lane by name, starting none of its own (#483).
  A reviewer whose card its builder blocks while it waits (to ask the user) keeps watching it rather than moving on, and
  reviews it when Hive wakes it once the card is unblocked and back in Review (#481).
  A reviewer woken by Hive's own loop wake, with no watch of its own, reviews the card and waits for the next (#405).
  A builder told no rounds or wait gets the workspace's Card loop settings for its lane and its wait; one told its own keeps them (#412).
  The Assistant at Look and advise lists the running lanes when asked, and changes none (#500).
- **With `work-on-card` deleted**, the board rules still hold, and **an edited skill** is the one followed.
- **The Assistant**:
  - at Look and advise, changes nothing;
  - at Control agents, starts a card (which worked), waits for it, and the card gets done;
  - with full control, plans as cards without starting them.
  - in Coordinator mode with a team (#402): reads run-lanes, briefs each builder and reviewer with the card-loop skill,
    their cards and partner, and ends its turn with one live watch on every lane's last card (scored on the watch it
    ends with, which replaces any before it, and on any move of those cards); woken by a failed review or an agent's
    question, it reads the card, sweeps the board, watches every lane again (not only the card that woke it) and leaves
    the fix (or the answer) to the loop (or the user); moves a card between running lanes; places a follow-up in the lane
    that owns its files; and follows two lanes through Hive's real wakes as each ends, re-watching what is left, until
    both have ended (the fake Claude Code acts out the Assistant's wakes from its `fake-wakes-Assistant.txt`);
  - in every mode (#325, #402): cards it plans are complete (80+ characters each), an open design question reaches the
    user, and one card on one agent loads no run-lanes and starts no lane.

## Running

```bash
npm run scenarios                             # the fake Claude Code: free, deterministic (a failure fails the run)
npm run scenarios -- --provider fake-codex    # the fake Codex: the same, through Hive's Codex adapter
npm run scenarios -- --provider fake-copilot  # the real Copilot CLI offline against a scripted model: the same, at no cost
npm run scenarios -- --save-baseline fake-main                                  # keep this run's benchmark as a baseline
npm run scenarios -- --provider codex --repeat 3 --budget 2                     # a model trial, 3 samples a scenario
npm run scenarios -- --provider claude-code --model haiku --budget 2            # model trials: opt-in
npm run scenarios -- --provider codex --model gpt-5.6-luna --budget 2           # Codex, in its test home
npm run scenarios -- --only work-on-card,review-card --keep                     # some scenarios, keeping their folders
node tests/scenarios/measure.cjs              # what sessions are given about Hive, measured from real launches
```

The scenarios run the dev build in `out/`. A run first checks it is built from the source as it is now (the e2e
runner's build stamp, `tests/e2e/build.mjs`) and rebuilds it if not, so a run or a baseline never measures other code.
Hive's test copies run quiet (`src/main/testQuiet.ts`): no window on screen, no focus taken, no notifications.
After each scenario, once Hive has closed, the harness stops what of it still runs (a command an agent started can
outlive its session: #542): what the scenario's Hive started (its process tree, taken before it closes, each by pid and
start time), and what names the scenario's folder on its command line (the folder itself, never a sibling whose name
starts the same) and started after the scenario did (`tests/e2e/folderProcesses.cjs`; the result's `leftOver` says how
many). A folder it still can't remove is kept and named in the result (`kept`) rather than ending the run. Setup helpers
that start an agent for the fixture (a builder working, an agent idle) fail the scenario (`setup: …`, with the
environment problem when the screen shows one) when it doesn't get there, rather than run on a fixture it didn't get.

- **The fakes** (`fake`, the default, `fake-codex` and `fake-copilot`) act each scenario out with their scripted commands (`skill NAME`, `boardmove`,
  `boardreview`, `boardcomment`). It checks the harness itself and the board rules Hive enforces, at no cost. Checks
  only a model's own work can meet are skipped there (listed as SKIP). `fake-copilot` is the real Copilot CLI, offline,
  in a home of the run's own: a scripted stand-in model (`tests/e2e/fake-copilot-api.cjs`) turns the same commands into
  Copilot's own tool calls (its skill tool, the hive MCP server's tools), so its hooks, skills and transcript are
  Copilot's. It needs the Copilot CLI installed (the run is skipped without it) and no sign-in.
- **Model trials** cost tokens, and run only in the providers' **test homes**: never the user's own `~/.claude` or
  `~/.codex`, and never a copy of their credentials (refreshing a copy could sign the user out).
  - **Claude Code** uses `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test\claude` (`HIVE_TEST_CLAUDE_HOME` overrides it). Sign in to it once, by
    hand, with the account the trials may use:
    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hive-test\claude" | Out-Null; $env:CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hive-test\claude"; claude
    ```
    Then `/login` in it. It runs in Accept edits, with `mcp__hive`, `Bash`, `PowerShell`, `Skill` and `Monitor` (a
    shell command whose output it follows, #613) allowed on the command line, so it never asks and never needs bypass
    mode.
  - **Codex** uses its test home (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test\codex`, signed in once as tests/e2e/README.md says), in
    Full access.
  - **Without a sign-in**, a trial prints `SKIP all scenarios: … isn't signed in to its test home` and does nothing. It
    never opens a login.
  - **Stopped by the environment** (#302): a sign-in that has expired since (the credentials file is still there),
    a usage or rate limit, an overloaded API or the network. When Hive shows the session waiting for a sign-in, or the
    CLI's own notes say one of these (matched with the e2e runner's list, `environmentProblem` in tests/e2e/lib.cjs;
    never the prompt or the model's replies), the trial ends at once as `SKIP environment: <why>`: no check is failed,
    no cost is assumed, and the provider's other trials are skipped with one line saying what to do (sign in to the test
    home by hand, or run them again later). results.json and summary.md say "skipped: environment: …", and
    benchmark.json has the sample as incomplete, so Performance → Compare counts no sample for it. To check this
    without a model: `npm run scenarios -- --only work-on-card --signed-out` (the fake Claude Code acts out an expired
    sign-in; fakes only). A CLI that exits before its session starts (an OAuth session it couldn't refresh: "Failed to
    authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed", exit 1) is matched by its last screen, the reason
    Hive logs, or, for Claude Code, its own `auth status --json` in the test home; anything else ends the trial at once
    as `ERROR the session ended at launch: …`, not after the trial's limits (#577). `--signed-out=launch` acts it out.
  - Each scenario is one session of the chosen model, 6 minutes at most. `--budget` (USD, API-equivalent, above 0,
    default 2) stops the run once the scenarios so far cost that much. A trial that reports no cost makes the spend
    unknown, so no further trial starts unless `--allow-unknown-cost` is given; the summary then says the total is
    unknown (the reported subtotal plus the unpriced trials), never $0.
    The usual reason is a model Hive has no price for (a Codex trial's cost is Hive's estimate): the guard names the
    model; add its published price to `SHIPPED_PRICES` (`src/shared/prices.ts`) or pass `--model` with a priced one.
  - Models vary from run to run: a trial reports, it doesn't fail the run.
- **Several runs at once** (from different worktrees, or the same one) don't touch each other: each run claims a
  **lane** from the e2e runner's pool (`tests/e2e/lanes.mjs`), and its scenarios' profiles and workspaces go in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test\scenarios\lanes\<k>\<scenario>-<provider>` (where `--keep` leaves them), with the lane's
  first port as the test Hive's Agent API port. The run prints its lane when it starts. Ten runs at once (scenario and
  e2e runs together) is the most: an eleventh waits for a lane, saying who holds them (#707; `--no-wait` fails at
  once instead), and builds once it has one, so it tests the source as it is then (#735). A run of more than five
  scenarios, or with
  `--repeat`, is a heavy run: it waits for one of the machine's test slots, as heavy e2e runs do, saying who holds them
  (`--no-wait` fails at once instead; tests/e2e/README.md, "Heavy runs queue").
- **Results** go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hive-test\scenarios\results\<time>-<provider>`: `results.json` (each scenario's
  checks, skills read, executed hive calls and mentions, versions, guidance and source, usage) and `summary.md` (a
  table). `BASELINE.md` here records the latest baseline. Run the trials again after changing Hive's guidance, a skill
  or a tool's description, and compare.

Bump `FIXTURES_VERSION` in `scenarios.cjs` when a scenario's setup or checks change.

## Benchmarks: before and after a change

Each run also writes `benchmark.json` (schema `hive-benchmark/1`, `benchmark.cjs`): for every scenario and sample, whether
it passed its checks and what Hive's own parts cost in it. Hive's performance metrics are read before the launch and after
the turn (`GET /v1/metrics` of the run's own workspace), and the difference is the scenario's:
- **Context Hive gave the session**: launch guidance in parts (core, project, the Assistant's role and mode, the skills' catalog), the
  hive tools' list, and every tool reply (characters and UTF-8 bytes, exact; never tokens).
- **Work**: tool calls (detail ones too), calls the hive server ran, repeated identical calls, failures, Agent API
  requests and bytes (the harness's own reads are left out), time.
- **Skills**: delivered skills' bytes (what was available, not what a model read), skills not delivered, and the skill
  service's scans, misses and bytes read.
- **The provider's usage** of the session (a new one, so its total is the scenario's), compared only when every sample on
  both sides reported it. A fake's tokens mean nothing; a cost is compared only when both sides have one.

Compare two runs in Hive: **Performance → Compare → Import…** each `benchmark.json` (in the Performance view, with the
whole workspace selected: a benchmark is its test workspace's, never a project's or the own work's). Each sample keeps
every check (passed, failed, skipped), the measurement's coverage, and the guidance and skill revisions the session was
given. Scenarios are judged **correctness first**, check by check:
- *Smaller, still correct*: less Hive context; every check that passed still passes and still runs; no more calls,
  failures (failed calls, tool errors, API failures, cancellations) or retries.
- *Smaller but failing*: less context but a check passed or ran less often. A cut that breaks a workflow isn't an
  improvement.
- *Larger or worse*, *No change* (within 1%), *Incomplete* (no completed sample, all checks skipped, or not fully
  measured: recording off, measurements dropped, a part missing), and scenarios only one side ran.
- What wasn't measured is **unknown**, never zero: a total exists only when every part it adds up is known.

Two runs are **comparable** only with the same fixtures version, provider, fake or model (and, for a model, the same model,
effort and mode), and neither's source changed while it ran. Otherwise the page says why and the numbers are only shown.
A fake's token usage is simulated and never compared. A stale launch (the session got other
guidance than the run started with) and incomplete samples are left out, and said. With one sample a side there is no
spread to judge a change by: use `--repeat N` for model trials.

- **Fakes** prove routing, delivery, sizes and failure handling: deterministic, free. Their board steps and
  `hive TOOL {json}` go through the real hive MCP server (`tests/e2e/fake-bridge.cjs`), except the fake Claude Code's
  board moves, which call the Agent API directly (its e2e suites read their answers). So the fake Codex's runs measure
  tool replies for board work and the fake Claude Code's don't. Compare like with like.
- **Model trials** are opt-in, cost tokens, and only report (models vary). They record the model, effort, mode, CLI
  version and that they ran in the provider's test home.
- **Controlled pairs** (fixtures v5): **list-compact** and **list-detail** ask for the same three cards, the compact list
  against the explicit detail form, with the same required correctness (every card listed; detail also has each
  acceptance line), so their reply sizes compare. **skill-unchanged** and **skill-changed** do the same work, the second
  with a skill edited inside the measured window (`beforeLaunch`, after the first metrics read): the skill service's
  hits, misses and changes show the cache's work, and the session must get the edited revision.
- **Baselines**: `--save-baseline NAME` copies the run's `benchmark.json` to `scenarios/baselines/NAME.json`: the new
  one is read first and swapped in atomically, and an existing baseline of that name is archived as
  `NAME.<its time>.json` (`-2`, `-3`… if that name is taken), never overwritten; the 5 newest archives are kept. Each run
  gets a results folder of its own; the newest 30 are kept. Nothing is invented for a run that wasn't recorded.
- `tests/fixtures/benchmarks` holds a baseline from a real fake run, an intentional reduction of it and the same
  reduction that broke `card-detail`. `tests/benchmark.test.ts` checks that the first is "smaller, still correct" and the
  second "smaller but failing".
- **Overhead**: the two metrics reads cost a few milliseconds a scenario (`metricsOverheadMs` in the artifact); the
  collector's own cost is in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
