// Unit tests run in Node, whose libuv asserts (and kills the worker: "Assertion failed: !_wcsnicmp(filename, dir, dirlen),
// file src\win\fs-event.c") when fs.watch watches a folder by its 8.3 short name and a file in it is reported by its short
// name too. GitHub's runner has its temp folder at C:\Users\RUNNER~1\…, so any test watching a workspace in tmpdir() can
// hit it. Electron's libuv doesn't assert (checked, #389), so Hive itself is unaffected. Here every watch watches the
// folder's real path instead: the same folder, and the same file names relative to it. Tests keep their short paths
// everywhere else, so comparisons with git's long ones are still tested as they are on CI.
