// Where an installer built in a git worktree goes (#150): the user looks for installers in the main checkout's dist, so
// `npm run dist` in an agent's worktree copies the installer, its blockmap, latest.yml and build-info.json there too
// (the worktree keeps its own). It never replaces an installer of the same name built from other code without saying
// so: build-info.json beside each says what it was built from, and is only written when that is certain (the code
// didn't change while it was built). Several worktrees can copy at once: a lock in the main dist makes each check and
// copy the whole set in turn. Kept apart from dist.mjs so tests/distcopy.test.ts can check it with a temporary
// repository and worktrees.
