/**
 * An agent's state as the session page marks it (#973, Hive 0.9.0): four states, each drawn with its own shape as well
 * as its colour (StateMark), so they read apart without colour. Projected from what Hive already knows (the status
 * word, a question, a stall, a card blocked on the user); it detects nothing of its own.
 * - waiting: waiting for you (a permission prompt, a question, a sign-in, a card blocked on you): a diamond;
 * - stalled: nothing will move it on (its CLI failed, its turn has been silent with its state unknown, or it left the
 *   cards it loops on unwatched): a square;
 * - working: a turn, its start, a compaction or background tasks running: a pulsing dot;
 * - idle: ready, finished, watching cards, stopped or no session: a ring.
