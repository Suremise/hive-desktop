/**
 * Advanced settings (#367): the details Hive relies on that a CLI update can break, or that only power users change,
 * gathered as named, documented defaults. A CLI's prompt text, the field names it sends, the timeouts Hive gives its
 * hooks and the hive MCP server: when one changes, an override in Settings → Advanced (or advanced.json) fixes it
 * without a Hive release. Data only, never code: patterns, names, numbers. Each value is checked before it is used, and
 * one that doesn't check out falls back to the default with a warning.
 *
 * A CLI's value (CLI-facing: what Hive reads from it, or gives it) carries samples from recorded fixtures
 * (tests/fixtures/advanced and the other recordings; tests/advanced.test.ts checks each sample is in its fixture): for one
 * Hive reads, what the CLI sent, which the default must read; for one Hive gives the CLI, the CLI taking it (its hooks
 * arriving, its own listing of the value). An override is tried against the same samples: one that no longer reads them
 * is kept (that's the point when the CLI changed) and says so. A CLI's override records the CLI version it was made for,
 * and is flagged once another version is installed.
 *
 * Pure data and helpers: no React, no Node (Settings, the main process and the Assistant's settings tools share it).
 * Their text is messages (#767): Settings shows it in the user's language, and the Assistant's tools, Hive's log and
 * its errors read the English.
