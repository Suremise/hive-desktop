/**
 * What Hive tells an agent that has something to read (#650, plans/2026-10-12-messaging-redesign.md §3.2, §3.5): a
 * notice in a hook's reply while it works (a checkpoint, after a tool call), one before its turn ends (the Stop drain), or
 * a short line typed into an idle agent (the doorbell). Each is Hive's own fixed wording with counts by kind, card
 * numbers and delivery ids, never a delivery's body, a sender's name or anything a person or an agent wrote: those are
 * fetched with hive_inbox, labelled with their sender, as data. Codex takes hook context as developer messages, so this
 * text must stay code-owned. No imports beyond shared types: hive-mcp.js runs outside the app bundle.
