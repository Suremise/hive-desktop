/**
 * What Hive writes in a card's history (#846, E10b of #677), as messages: main stores each entry's English in `what`
 * (agents read it, Hive's own code matches it, scenarios too) and its message's id and values in `whatText`, and the
 * card dialog shows that in the window's language. Imports only msg.ts: hive-mcp reaches shared/tasks, and this stays
 * out of its way. A column (`{column}`) or a reason (`{why}`) is stored as its key and the message chooses its words;
 * other values are names, numbers and the user's own words, the same in every language.
