 * session's usage. Rows of `step` seconds with any use, oldest first: [their start (seconds since the epoch, a multiple
 * of step), input, output, cache write, cache read, requests, the cost report covering them, flags, and the model they
 * ran on (an index into `models`; absent or -1: the session's model)]. A second each (about a row per request), so a
 * card's hold ends where its agent's request did; a session with more rows than MAX_ROWS has them merged into longer
 * steps (10 s, 100 s…), each step's charges into one (boundTimeline).
 *
 * `reports` are the charges the provider reported, each with the requests it covers (a row's report: its index, or -1
 * for none): Claude Code's running total, each increase covering the requests since the last; Copilot's credits at each
 * turn's checkpoint, covering the requests since the one before. A charge is split only between the requests it covers,
 * so a later one never changes what an earlier card cost. Rows with no report are Hive's estimate (≈).
