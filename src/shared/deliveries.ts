 * by one scheduler (main/deliveries.ts): every way into an agent makes one (#649). The agent collects them with
 * hive_inbox (received) and acknowledges them once it has acted on them (acked). This file is the pure part: the states and their moves, coalescing, the typed line and the
 * inbox's reply. No imports beyond shared files with none of their own: hive-mcp.js runs outside the app bundle.
