/**
 * The Assistant panel's status line (#312), from what Hive knows of its session: "Working", "Idle", "Waiting for you",
 * "Waiting for #271, #273 → Review (watch until 22:22)". A card watch's cards are kept apart (`cards`, between `text`
 * and `after`) so each can be a chip that opens its card. `tone`: attention when it needs the user, busy while it works,
 * calm while it is idle or waits on cards or tasks, off when it isn't running. `approvals`: the titles of Hive's questions
 * its actions wait on (stopping a busy agent…), shown under the line: waiting for the user's answer comes first, over
 * working, idle and a card watch; sign-in and an error keep their words, with it added.
 *
 * Window text, in the language shown (#885): the line is only ever shown, never read by the Assistant.
