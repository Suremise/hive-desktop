/**
 * Lane watches (#531): a watch on whole lanes (main/lanes.ts), not cards. On 10 Oct the Assistant, with seven lanes and
 * about 25 open cards, swapped cards in and out of its 20-card watch on every wake, missed one (#390 sat in Review
 * unreviewed), and was woken on every column move, most of which needed nothing. A lane watch follows each lane's cards
 * as the lane goes on (cards added included, no card limit), and counts only what a coordinator acts on.
 *
 * #726: the release card #720 was in no lane, so HB6 waited about 45 minutes for Darren's push before the Assistant
 * noticed. The same watch takes cards beside its lanes (`cards`, told as a card watch tells them, and when one becomes
 * blocked), and wakes when an agent of the projects it follows starts waiting for the user (`waiting`).
