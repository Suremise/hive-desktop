/**
 * GitHub Copilot's side of the shared provider data (the Copilot CLI, `copilot`): its modes, reasoning levels and models.
 * Its footer shows two things, the agent mode (Interactive, Plan, Autopilot: Shift+Tab cycles them) and the approval
 * (Manual Approval, or Allow All), and Hive's modes are the combinations it can tell apart there. The approval is Allow
 * All when launched with --allow-all, and also once a turn has run in Autopilot: entering it sets Allow All for the rest
 * of the session ("Permission policy: Allow All for this session"), which stays when Shift+Tab leaves Autopilot
 * ("Interactive · Allow All", read as Allow all; #490). Checked with Copilot CLI 1.0.93 (the #403 spike, #490's probes).
 * Used by both processes.
