/**
 * Removes an unused worktree (#353), the user's choice from the Overview. Reserved first, so no agent can be given it
 * meanwhile (`reserveForRemoval`, which addAgent and template loads check under the project file's lock), then refused
 * if git no longer lists it, an agent works in it, or it is a folder Hive never deletes. Without `force` (Remove), only
 * a merged, clean one, checked now (`worktreeCheck`, then `removeCheckedWorktree`: never --force, its branch deleted only
 * from the commit checked, and only while the main branch the user was shown, `expectInto`, still holds it). With
 * `force` (Remove anyway), the token of the preview the user confirmed (used once, and only within PREVIEW_MS of it,
 * #373): the worktree is snapshotted again and removed only
 * if nothing differs (folder, branch, commit, main branch, every file); then the folder (forced) and the branch the
 * preview named, only from the commit it showed.
