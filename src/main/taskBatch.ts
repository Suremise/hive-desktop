 * limit, however many cards it has (#488: a bulk move never stops part-way for the limit), before any card changes. Each
 * card is then written only if the guard still passes after its last read, under its own lock: the control level and the session that asked must still allow it (the user may have turned the
 * level down, or the Assistant been restarted, while the batch waited for a card). A card refused for any reason is left
 * as it was, and every card, changed or refused, is recorded in the activity list on its own. The batch stays counted when
 * some of its cards are refused, as a refused single change does. Returns each card's outcome, in the order given.
