 * Hive's performance metrics, one store per open workspace (shared/metrics.ts has the contract). Recording is a few
 * map updates into the current hour's bucket; nothing is read from disk on the request path. Buckets are hourly for 7
 * days, then folded into days, kept 30 days, and saved (debounced) in `.hive/metrics/metrics.json`, which is git-ignored
 * and machine-local. Every dimension comes from a fixed set (route templates, Hive's tool names, provider ids), each
 * bucket has caps on projects and series, the store has a cap on buckets whichever way the clock moves, and the file
 * has a size cap: what doesn't fit is dropped and counted. The saved file is untrusted input: size-checked before it
 * is read and checked field by field. Nothing stores a prompt, a body, a token, a URL or a path.
 *
 * Work is recorded against the workspace it started in: a MetricsHandle (its store and lifetime) is taken before any
 * await, and a record after that workspace closed or its window opened another is dropped, never moved to the next.
 * Turned off (Settings → Sessions → Record performance metrics), nothing is recorded; what was recorded stays until it
 * is reset.
