/**
 * The turn ledger (#648): which of a launch's CLI turns runs and which are over, by the CLI's own turn ids, so a hook
 * about a turn that is over can't make the agent working again (a PostToolUse that reaches Hive after the turn's Stop:
 * one way #642's Codex agent could have stayed "working"), and so Hive can tell a missing turn end from a busy agent.
 * Pure, so each rule is unit-tested; SessionManager keeps one per launch and puts each hook through `admit` before the
 * status rules (hookStatus).
 *
 * The rules (the Assistant's, for #648):
 * 1. **Only a start opens or reopens a turn.** A prompt opens one. After its Stop, a turn reopens only on a start of it:
 *    a tool start with a call id not seen in it before (or none: a CLI whose hooks name no calls), or Hive's own
 *    continuation of a Stop (`hiveContinued`). End news (a tool end, an interrupt, the CLI idle, a refused sign-in, a
 *    Stop) never reopens one. Any hook naming a turn that is neither the open nor the latest one is stale, with no effect
 *    on status, and **an id Hive doesn't remember is stale, never new**: the bound on the ids kept (`seen`) can't make an
 *    old one a new turn. A prompt alone opens a turn under an id never seen (the CLI awaits its hook before the turn, so
 *    a prompt hook is never late). This holds for every kind of hook that names a turn, launch-wide ones too (a delayed
 *    PreCompact or SessionEnd of an earlier turn is stale); hooks naming none are launch-wide (SessionStart, a
 *    compaction's) or from a CLI whose hooks name none (Copilot), and are the latest turn's.
 *    Two starts the CLI makes by itself, under an id of their own with no prompt hook (Claude Code 2.1.296, verified):
 *    - **a compaction** (`/compact` while idle, or the CLI's own): its PreCompact, under an id never seen, opens that
 *      compaction, not a turn; only its own launch-wide news follows under that id (SessionStart, PostCompact,
 *      SessionEnd), until a turn begins.
 *    - **a background task's wake** (Darren's decision, 12 Oct): it sends its prompt hook (a `<task-notification>`), so it
 *      opens like any prompt. Should that hook be lost, a tool start whose call id the launch never saw opens the turn,
 *      only while the CLI's transcript says a task of it just ended (`woke`), never merely because a task runs.
 *    Past the bound on the ids kept (`forgot`), neither opens anything: an id not remembered may be an earlier one.
 * 2. **No screen timing decides a continuation**: rule 1 decides it from the ids alone, so a hook reaching Hive before the
 *    CLI redraws changes nothing.
 * 3. **Times are when a hook reached Hive** (`now`, taken before it waits its turn in the launch's queue), not when it
 *    was handled: the CLI's records are compared with them.
 * - A prompt in the running turn (its id) is one the CLI takes mid-turn; one Hive put there itself (`expectInjected`, a
 *   message delivered into the running turn) isn't a new prompt at all.
 * - A Stop ends its turn, unless Hive's own reply carried it on (continuations fire no prompt, so only the Stop Hive
 *   answered with nothing ends it).
 *
 * A timer never ends a turn: silence (`silentFor`) only makes Hive look for the CLI's own record of the turn's end
 * (`reconciles` by id, `unheardStop` by its Stops' times) or read its screen, and failing those, say the state is unknown.
