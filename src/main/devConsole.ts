 * The developer console's capture (#636): rings of events per source, kept only while the console is open on them
 * (#366 decision 4). A source is captured from its first subscriber to its last: before and after, `capture()` returns
 * at once without building its event, and no ring is kept, so a Hive with no console open does no work and holds no
 * memory for it.
 *
 * Subscribers are the console's windows (and, with #638, their recordings). Readers (agents' and the Assistant's hive
 * tools) subscribe to nothing: they read what an open console is capturing, and are told when it isn't. Every event is
 * redacted as it is kept (shared/devConsole.ts); a subscriber that opted into text (the user's own recording) is sent a
 * second copy with text kept, and only it.
