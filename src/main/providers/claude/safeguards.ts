/**
 * Claude Code's safeguard stops and model changes in transcript lines (2.1.296, #606).
 * - A stop it retries once writes a system note ("Opus 5.5's safeguards stopped the response above · …", matched by the
 *   advanced setting claude-code.safeguard.note, so a reworded one can be caught by an override) and, as the very next
 *   entry, a notice for the model (a user entry, isMeta, with `refusedMessageId`: the stopped response). The pair is one
 *   stop, by that adjacency or the notice's `parentUuid`; a notice alone is a stop by its own `refusedMessageId`.
 * - A flagged request answered by another model, or by none, is a system record (SAFEGUARD_DEFAULTS.claudeRecords:
 *   `model_refusal_fallback` with `originalModel`, `fallbackModel` and `scope`; `model_refusal_no_fallback`), a stop by
 *   its `requestId`, and for the session a switch the safeguard made (flagged). Claude Code may first have asked the user
 *   about it (its prompt, which Hive sees on screen): `asked`.
 * Each stop counts once by its identity, however close two are, and carries its turn (the person's prompt that started
 * it, in the transcript's order), so a stop Hive saw on screen and Claude Code's record of it match whenever, and in
 * whichever order, Hive reads them (withScreenStops). Commands typed in it (/feedback about a stop, a
 * local_command entry), the person's own prompts and side conversations (subagents) never count. The model an assistant
 * message ran on (`message.model`) changing after a stop is the fallback too; Claude Code's own synthetic messages, and
 * a response another model answered alone (scope local), don't change it.
