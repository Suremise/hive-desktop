 * Code mode (Codex 0.160): commands run inside an `exec` script (`tools.exec_command({...})`) that prints what the
 * model chooses, and Codex records no start, only each command's end, so a start needs evidence (#162):
 * - an id the output shows: the result's session_id, or a script that reads session_id and printed only numbers
 *   (`text(r.session_id)`), not one of its commands that ended within it; it ends by that process_id;
 * - else a script that runs its one exec_command once (runsOnce) and completed with no command ended: Codex writes
 *   the end of every command that ends within a script before the script's output, so it is still running. It
 *   gets a stand-in id and ends with the CommandExecution of the same command text.
 * Anything less clear (a loop, a condition, a failed or aborted script, an end that could be its own) counts nothing:
 * a command missed rather than one counted that isn't running.
