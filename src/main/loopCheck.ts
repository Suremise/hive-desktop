 * Agents in a card loop left with no card watch (#376). An agent that has watched cards in this run of Hive is in a
 * loop; if its turn ends with no live watch while a card it was looping on is still in play, nothing will wake it when
 * that card changes, and its lane stalls (7 Oct: a wake typed into a Codex reviewer was never submitted, and it sat
 * "finished" for hours while the builder waited on it). After a short grace (a wake being taken, a watch being started)
 * those cards are marked on the agent (`notWatching`), so they show as stalled ("R6 isn't watching #333"), and the user
 * is told once. Its cards in play: the ones it last watched, in Doing or Review, and any in Review it is the agent or
 * reviewer of. The Hive Assistant isn't checked: it watches cards as it likes.
