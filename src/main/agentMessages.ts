/**
 * Messages left for an agent (#530: hive_message_agent), now deliveries (#647, deliveries.ts): a re-brief for the work it
 * is on, saved in its project's .hive/deliveries.json and given by the delivery service like everything else (#650): a
 * busy agent is told of it at its next tool call or before its turn ends, an idle or watching one by the doorbell (a
 * watching agent is woken by it, and its watch carries on), and it reads it with hive_inbox, labelled with its sender,
 * then acks it. On 10 Oct the user pasted about ten of the Assistant's messages into agents' panes because
 * hive_prompt_agent refused every agent of a running card loop; a message goes in whatever the agent is doing.
 *
 * Its sender's permission is worked out again at every step, until the agent reads it: one no longer allowed is refused.
 * At most MAX_QUEUED waiting per agent, each at most MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS. They survive the agent's stops and Hive's
 * restarts; the Assistant's are refused once the launch that left them has ended (#645). One tied to a card's round
 * (`card`, #652) is stale, never given, once that card has moved on: passed, out of Doing and Review, or in a new round.
