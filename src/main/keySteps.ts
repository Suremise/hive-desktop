 * Types key steps into a CLI's terminal (#396). A plain step's keys go in as they are. A pick step reads the CLI's
 * screen as rendered, every 100 ms until it finds what it needs or `pickTimeoutMs` passes, and types what it chose
 * (Codex's /permissions menu: the number its menu shows beside a preset's label, which a Codex version can reorder).
 * Throws PickNotFound when it never finds it, after the steps before it have gone in.
 *
 * `ready` says whether the CLI is safe to type into now, waiting while it may become so (a task waits while the CLI is
 * busy): true, or why not, which stops the typing (KeysStopped, fail closed). It is asked before every write, and
 * nothing is awaited between its answer and the write, so each key goes into a CLI that was safe just then (#363).
 *
 * A step with `heldOn` submits something (Enter after a command, #363): if the screen still holds it unrun once the CLI
 * is ready, has then had `heldSettleMs` to draw what it did, and is still ready, its keys go in again, at most RESENDS times. Only what
 * the screen shows counts: a submission the CLI took (it ran, or the CLI queued it to run when it is free) leaves the
 * input, so it is never sent twice, and one that doesn't show as held isn't sent again on a guess.
