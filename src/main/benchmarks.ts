 * Kept comparisons (#117): scenario benchmarks and Performance exports a user imported (or kept from the page), each a
 * validated, normalised artifact in the workspace's `.hive/metrics/benchmarks` (git-ignored with the metrics), at most
 * BENCHMARK_LIMITS.kept: when full, the oldest unpinned one goes, once the new one is safely kept. Each scope (the whole
 * workspace, its own work, a project) has its own list and remembers its chosen baseline and run; a project's page sees
 * only its own project's.
 *
 * The index is the only authority, and it records every change in progress: an entry being added (`adding`) or removed
 * (`removing`), with the change's id. Nothing is deleted except what a validated index says is being removed, or the file
 * of an add whose change never finished; a removal stays recorded until its file is really gone. A file the index doesn't
 * account for is never deleted: it is moved, once, to `quarantine/` (bounded). A damaged index is set aside (bounded) and
 * rebuilt from the valid files, and is never acted on.
 *
 * Every operation is bound to the workspace it started in: its folder and lifetime are taken before anything is awaited
 * (a dialog, a read, the queue), every write is staged and renamed into place only while that workspace is still open,
 * and an operation whose workspace closed or switched meanwhile is refused rather than written into the next one.
