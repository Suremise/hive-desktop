/**
 * Decisions reach an agent waiting for the user (#401). An agent asks the user, and its turn ends; the user answers
 * elsewhere (through the Assistant), and the answer is recorded on its card as decisions (#357). An agent waiting makes no
 * tool calls, so the flag in its next reply never comes: Hive gives it one line, a delivery (#649: the user's answer,
 * which the agent acks), offered as a card watch's wake is (#376, #430: taken, or marked) when its turn has ended (ready
 * or finished: not working, not on background tasks, not watching, whose wake tells it, and never into a question or
 * permission prompt it shows), the user isn't typing there and no line of Hive's waits to be taken. Decisions landing
 * together are told together: after a short settle. What a line told isn't told again once it is received (in memory);
 * the card's history says whom Hive told. The Assistant's own cards aren't its: project agents only. A line is made again
 * just before it is offered, and typed only while it is still true: until Enter, nothing on the board changed and the
 * agent read no card since (else it is made again at the next try).
