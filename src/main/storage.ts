/**
 * Purge… (#1138): removes what a preview (`previewId`) listed, those of its keys in `listed`, to the Recycle Bin or
 * (`permanent`) for good. Each is checked against what the preview saw, not what it would list now: still listed by a
 * fresh plan, of the same kind, its file unchanged (size and modified time), and for a backup whether it is the
 * session's last copy as the preview said; what changed is skipped and reported, and nothing it didn't list goes (an
 * attachment added since stays). A session's things go together, checked again with it reserved and its backups locked
 * (sessions.purge), what it used recorded first, and only with every listed backup unchanged; one whose last copy goes is
 * deleted from Hive, as Delete Session does. What is left of sessions Hive no longer has goes with that id reserved,
 * once no session has it; old kept usage goes once the usage history has it. Running sessions, the usage history and the
 * CLIs' own files are never touched. A preview is applied once, and only within PREVIEW_MS of making it.
