/**
 * The usage history's database (#1106): `.hive/usage.db`, beside the workspace's `hive.db`, under each session host's
 * scope (a project's id, `assistant` for the Assistant), as its session records are (#1061). Its own file (Darren, 20
 * Oct), so the usage worker's commits never wait on a board change held across awaits, never look like another
 * process's change to the board's poll, and an older Hive still opens `hive.db` for writing. Only the usage worker opens
 * it (usageWorker.ts): it writes, and answers main's queries. No Electron here: the worker can't load it.
 *
 * Real tables, each value a typed column (Darren, 20 Oct: "proper tables, not JSON in a database"); the parser's saved
 * state is the one blob (a parser's own fields, taken up as they were):
 * - `usage_sessions`: a row a session. `source`: read from its `transcript`, a `kept` usage imported from before, or an
 *   `external` session (started outside Hive: kept for the Sessions list, never counted in totals). Who it was (provider,
 *   agent, name, folder); where it was read (`path`, the size and modified time read, the offset read to); the parser's
 *   saved state (`state` at `state_offset`, its shape and the Hive version that saved it); the holds its card rows were
 *   shared out by (`holds_key`); and what isn't a sum of its rows (title, model, CLI version, context, activity…).
 * - `usage_rows`: its rows (shared/usageLedger.ts LedgerRow), keyed by session, day, model, card and role; what every
 *   usage view adds up.
 * - `usage_compactions`, `usage_safeguards`: its compactions in order, and its safeguard stops by model and the stops
 *   it may have asked about by turn (#606).
 * - `usage_timeline`, `usage_charges`: its use over time (shared/usageTimeline.ts: a row a second or step, with the
 *   charge covering it and its model) and the provider's charges, for spans of time no card row has (a lane's cost) and
 *   to share a session's cards out again when their holds change.
 * - `usage_baseline`: what was counted for a session before, by day (a kept usage imported from before the history, or
 *   what its rows had when a later read didn't match them): its rows never go below it (shared/usageLedger.ts
 *   applyBaseline), so nothing once counted is lost to a snapshot that counted less of something.
 * - `usage_meta`: per scope, or '' for the workspace (the backfill's record).
