/**
 * Hive's loop wakes (#405): a card loop's routine handoffs, delivered by Hive whether or not the agent set a card watch.

 * reviewer (the reviewer of a running lane with the card, else the agent that last reviewed it), so a solo user never
 * sees one; never for the agent that made the change; left to the agent's own watch when one tells it of the change; and
 * off for a project whose Project Settings → Card loops → Wake reviewers and builders is off.
 *
 * A delivery (#649, deliveries.ts: a card event, the latest per agent and card, at most a day), made at once and given
 * by the delivery service as everything is (#650: the doorbell when its agent is idle, a notice in its hooks while it
 * works). Made again just before it is offered or read, from the card and the lane as they are then (#652: what lands
 * with the handoff is in it, with no settle of its own): one no longer due is cancelled. Each one received (read with
 * hive_inbox) is noted in the card's history, as Hive.
