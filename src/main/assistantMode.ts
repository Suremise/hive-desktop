 * mode's habits, a delivery (#649: a control notice for that launch, deliveries.ts) typed into its conversation, which
 * keeps its context. Offered only while it is idle and the user isn't typing there; otherwise when it next is (only the
 * latest switch is told). Its session stopping drops the message; the conversation records the mode once it is received.
 *
 * Each conversation records the mode it was last given (SessionRecord.mode: the one it started in, or the last one
 * it was told), and a resumed one in another mode, or with none recorded, is told that mode the same way, once (#334): a
 * stop with a message waiting, or a switch while it was stopped, reaches it when it is resumed. The CLI may also keep
 * the system prompt the conversation started with (Claude Code's adapter asks for the current one).
