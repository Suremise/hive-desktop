 * Advanced settings (#367): Hive's overridable defaults (shared/advanced.ts), with the user's overrides in
 * %APPDATA%\Hive\advanced.json. Settings → Advanced and the Assistant's settings tools change them through set(); the file
 * can also be edited by hand, and Hive reads it again when it changes (a file it can't read as it is keeps what Hive had,
 * and says why). Code asks for a value with get(), pattern() or regExpOf(): an override that doesn't check out falls back
 * to the default (warned once in the log). Before load() (unit tests), every value is its default.
 *
 * A CLI's override records the CLI version it was made for (the installed one when it was set, or when Hive first learns
 * it; a value edited by hand, the one installed when Hive reads it, written back to the file so a restart keeps it);
 * Settings flags it once another version is installed, until the user keeps it for that one.
