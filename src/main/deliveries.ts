/**
 * The delivery service (#647, plans/2026-10-12-messaging-redesign.md §3.1). Everything Hive has for an agent to read is a
 * delivery record (shared/deliveries.ts), saved in its session host's .hive/deliveries.json (a project's, or the
 * Assistant's home's) with atomic writes, and restored when Hive starts. Every way into an agent makes one (#649): a
 * message, a task, a watch's or a loop's wake, the user's decisions, a mode notice, a lock's go-ahead, the carry-on after
 * a sign-in, a handover. This service alone offers them, to an idle agent by typing the doorbell (#650: Hive's fixed
 * words with counts and ids, shared/doorbell.ts, through lineWriter.typeLine); a busy one is told in its hooks' replies
 * instead (inboxNotices.ts). Producers neither type nor keep their own cursors.
 *
 * **Receipts.** A typed doorbell makes what it names offered. It is received only when the agent fetches it with
 * hive_inbox (#650: the doorbell carries no text, so its CLI taking the line is no receipt); never because it was typed.
 * A card event or a control notice is done then; a message, a task, a handover or the user's answer waits for the agent's
 * ack (hive_inbox), and one not acked OVERDUE_MINUTES after it was made is overdue. A doorbell its CLI took whose agent is
 * idle again without having read it rings once more (#650: its turn's Stop drain asked it first), never a third time; it
 * stays offered, unread in the pane, until it is read. One offered when Hive stopped, or when its agent's launch ended
 * before it was read, is uncertain: it may not have reached the agent, so it is offered once more, saying it may repeat,
 * and stays uncertain (shown) if that one isn't received either.
 *
 * **No inbox** (Darren's decision on #650): an agent that can't read an inbox (`readsInbox`: a project agent while the
 * Agent API or its hive server is off) is given no delivery, and its bodies are never typed instead: each is refused with
 * the reason its sender sees (`noInbox`: made, NoInbox; one already waiting, refused when next looked at). Only the
 * user's own action, a task they give it from Hive (Start), is typed as their input, as their typing in its pane is: no
 * delivery, no receipt.
 *
 * **Sources.** What made a delivery (`source`: a watch, a loop wake…) registers itself here: it can make its line again
 * just before it is offered, from things as they are then (`refresh`; null: no longer due, and it is cancelled), say
 * whether it still holds before each key (`holds`), and is told when it is received (its cursor moves on then, never on
 * "typed") or ends. A live delivery's source and `ref` name it: the same one is never made twice.
 *
 * **Transactions.** Each host's records change one transaction at a time (`transact`, under the host's lock): planned on
 * a copy of what is published, with its checks (below), saved by one atomic write, and only then published, so nothing (a
 * read, the pane) ever sees a change that isn't on disk. An operation takes effect at that save: a permission change that
 * lands while it is saved applies to the next operation, not this one (it was decided before). A save that fails changes
 * nothing, on disk or in memory (NotSaved): the rename never happened. The offer's writer checks again before each piece
 * of the line and its Enter (`offerHolds`).
 *
 * **Authority.** A sender's permission is worked out again at every step, from the sender saved with it and the settings
 * now (never a closure or token): the Assistant's needs Settings → Assistant → Control at Control agents and the launch
 * that sent it still running (#645: a launch that has ended sends nothing more; its waiting messages are refused, and the
 * refusal is in the Assistant's activity list and the agent's). One is for its agent's conversation when that was known.
 *
 * **Relevance** (#652). One tied to a card's round (`card` and `round`: a re-brief for the work under way) is stale once
 * that card has moved on (passed, done or archived, out of Doing and Review, or in a later round): ended as stale, with
 * why, never offered or given: checked under the host's lock as an offer or a read is planned (`relevanceNow`, judged
 * current right before the plan and read again if the board changed meanwhile; overtaken every time, the tied ones are
 * held back unread rather than judged on an outdated read), and as the board changes (`sweepStale`), so a doorbell
 * already rung for it finds nothing. On #699 (13 Oct) the Assistant's re-brief for a round's finding reached its
 * builder a second after the card passed, and it reopened the card to apply it.
 *
 * The rules, for every operation (create, offer, readInbox, ack, cancel): **one async lock per host**, inside it copy,
 * check (sender permission, expiry, the target conversation) and change the copy, save atomically, then publish and
 * return; no check after the save. A line typed into the agent is checked again by its writer before each key with the
 * same check (`offerHolds`); one that no longer holds gets no Enter. Once typed, the doorbell is never cleared or
 * withdrawn (#652): it names ids, never what they say, so an Enter again for one that no longer holds gives the agent
 * nothing (hive_inbox checks each delivery as it reads it). One the user typed into before its CLI took it is theirs:
 * never submitted by Hive, what it named waits again, and nothing more is typed there until a prompt is sent
 * (sessions.leaveToUser).
