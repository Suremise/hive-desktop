/**
 * Wake-on-change watches (#128): an agent registers what it waits for on the board (hive_wait_for_tasks with wake), ends
 * its turn, and Hive types one line into it when a watched card changes, or when its overall limit passes with no change.
 * Nothing runs while it waits. One watch per agent (a new one replaces it), kept in the workspace's .hive/watches.json so
 * it survives the agent being resumed and Hive restarting; it ends when its line is typed, or when the agent or the user
 * cancels it. A watch whose agent isn't running (or is busy, or the user is typing in it) is delivered when the agent is
 * idle again: nothing is typed over its work or the user's.
 *
 * - A watch keeps its caller's view of the board (`scope`: a project agent's project, null for the whole board) and every
 *   read is checked against it, so a card moved to another project reads as gone and nothing about it is told.
 * - A workspace's watches belong to that workspace's lifetime: the folder and lifetime are taken before anything waits,
 *   checked after every wait and before every write, and the watches are dropped when it closes or the window switches.
 * - Changes to a workspace's watches happen one at a time (`locked`), so a board change checked while a watch is being
 *   registered is checked again once it is in place, and a cancel can't be undone by a delivery that was under way.
 * - An agent watch (#416, hive_wait_for_agents with wake) is a watch that follows agents instead of cards: it fires when
 *   a watched agent's turn ends, it waits for the user, or it stops, checked on every status change. It is the agent's
 *   one watch like any other (a card watch replaces it, and it replaces one), kept, typed and ended the same way.
