/**
 * Whether an agent can take a line of Hive's now, as far as what it is doing goes (#649): the one place every way into an
 * agent asks it (deliveries, watches, the typed line's writer). It reads the turn ledger's facts (#648): the CLI running
 * (or, `stalled`, stopped by a refused sign-in), no turn running and none of unknown state (unknown is never idle), no
 * compaction, nobody asked, and, for new work (`free`, `stalled`), no background tasks that will start it again. A watch
 * is Hive's policy on top: `idle` takes a watching agent (a message or a wake; its watch carries on), `free` doesn't (it
 * takes no new work). Who holds the composer is the writer's to check (it holds it itself while it types). A state from
 * before the facts reads its status word, as before.
 *
 * #726: an agent whose turn has ended while its own background tasks run (a sleep or timer set to renew a merge slot,
 * shown as background) is `idle` for a message or a card event: HB6 slept 40 minutes that way and heard of neither
 * until it woke. Its CLI takes the line as a new turn (Claude Code; Codex and Copilot, whose tasks start no turn, were
 * already idle then). New work still waits for those tasks, which will start a turn of their own.
