/**
 * A terminal's command started only once Hive has put its process in the launch's job (#507), so that nothing it
 * starts can escape the job by starting before it was there.
 *
 * node-pty gives no way to start a process suspended, and on Windows it knows the process's id only once it runs. So
 * the terminal runs a gate first: a hidden PowerShell (a console program on every Windows, so it shares the terminal's
 * console, which Electron's own executable doesn't) that connects to a pipe made for this launch and waits for Hive's
 * word; meanwhile Hive puts the gate in the job. Then the gate starts the real command (in the job from its first
 * instruction, as is everything it starts) with the same command line node-pty would have given it, on the same
 * console, and ends with its exit code. The command and its arguments reach the gate in variables of its environment,
 * removed before the command starts, so nothing is quoted twice. The gate uses no cmdlet: PowerShell loads no module.
 * The gate starts the command only on Hive's explicit `go`: Hive refusing (`stop <why>`), the pipe failing or closing
 * without a word, all end the gate with that reason, and the command never runs. Hive says `go` only when its caller
 * says so (ptyHost's track: the process is in the job).
