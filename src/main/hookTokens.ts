 * Each launch's own hook token and private folder (#345). The hook server takes a hook call only with the token of the
 * launch it names (`?run=<runId>`), and a launch's token ends with it: a token that leaks can't speak for another
 * session or outlive its own. CLIs that send hooks over HTTP read it from the session's environment (`HIVE_HOOK_TOKEN`);
 * hook commands (curl) read the header from the launch's auth file.
 *
 * The auth file, and whatever else of a launch may hold a secret (Claude Code's settings, with a user's `--settings`
 * and its `env`; its MCP config, with the workspace's servers' own `env` and headers), go in the launch's private
 * folder in Hive's user data, `launches/<runId>`, never in the project: no file Hive generates in a project holds a
 * secret. The folder goes when the launch ends, and all of them when Hive starts.
