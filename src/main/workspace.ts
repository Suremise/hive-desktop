- \`mcp/\` — MCP server definitions (one \`<name>.json\` per server). Enable them in Hive.
- \`workspace.json\` — which MCP servers are on in the workspace (each runs only in the projects that turn it on too).
- \`hive.db\` — the task board (Hive's database). It is this machine's, like the Assistant's sessions: \`.gitignore\` keeps it out of git.
- \`usage.db\` — what each session used (the usage history the Overviews read). It is this machine's too, kept out of git.

MCP definitions must not contain secrets. Reference environment variables instead, e.g. \`"\${GITHUB_TOKEN}"\`.
