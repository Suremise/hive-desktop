/**
 * Notices in hooks (#650, plans/2026-10-12-messaging-redesign.md §3.2): a busy agent is told what it has unread at its
 * next checkpoint (a tool call of its own ended), and before its turn ends (the Stop drain), in the reply to that hook,
 * so nothing is typed into a working agent. The notice is Hive's fixed text with counts, cards and ids
 * (shared/doorbell.ts); the agent reads the bodies with hive_inbox, which alone makes them received. Each CLI says which
 * of its hooks can carry one (the adapter's noticeReply; sessions.hookReply asks only those).
 *
 * - **Checkpoint**: only deliveries it wasn't told of yet in this launch, so a long turn isn't told the same thing at
 *   every tool call; the drain and the doorbell catch one it let pass.
 * - **Drain**: everything unread, once a turn (sessions.hookReply: not after a continuation). Its reply carries the turn
 *   on, so the agent reads its inbox before it stops rather than being woken again by the doorbell.
