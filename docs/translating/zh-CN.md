# 简体中文 (`zh-CN`): style for Hive

**Status:** drafted by AI (Claude, October 2026), not yet reviewed by a native speaker. Its entry in
`src/shared/i18n/languages.ts` says the same (`ai: true` until it is reviewed).

**In the language picker:** 简体中文, marked (AI) while drafted by AI, with the note “由 AI 翻译，欢迎改进。”

**Improving it:** every Chinese message is in `locales/zh-CN/<area>.json`, one file per part of Hive. If a word is
wrong, stiff or unclear, change it there and open a pull request on GitHub (`Suremise/hive-desktop`):
`CONTRIBUTING.md` says how, and a small fix can be made in GitHub's web editor. If you change a term from the table
below, change it in every message and on this page in the same pull request, so Hive keeps one voice. A native
speaker's review takes the (AI) mark off.

## Voice

Hive's English is plain and direct: short sentences, everyday words, *you* for the reader, and it says what happens.
Translate the meaning, not the words, and keep the result as short and plain.

- **Addressing the reader:** 你, not 您, as most current software does. Leave it out where the sentence is clear
  without it (“已删除智能体 {agent}。”, not “你已删除智能体 {agent}。”). Where the English says *your*, usually say
  nothing.
- **Tone:** friendly and direct. Prefer an active verb to a nominal chain (“无法保存”, not “保存操作执行失败”). Avoid
  translationese such as 被 passives where an active sentence works, and long 的…的…的 chains.
- **Sentence length:** split a long English sentence into two. Chinese is shorter on screen than English, so keep
  labels short rather than padding them.

## Buttons, commands, titles

- **Buttons and menu commands:** a short verb phrase: “保存”, “删除”, “取消”, “添加智能体…”, “打开设置”. The same form
  everywhere, including the command palette.
- **Headings, labels, column names, status words:** nouns or short phrases: “设置”, “工作中”, “等待中”.
- **A trailing `…`** stays, with no space before it: “删除智能体…”. Don't turn it into ……
- **Column headings:** 搁置, 待办, 进行中, 评审, 已通过, 已完成.

## Grammar

- **Names have no gender** in Chinese, so agreement isn't a problem. A placeholder is a name inserted as it is.
- **Plurals:** Chinese has only the CLDR category *other*. Every plural message gives just `other`, plus any `=0` or
  `=1` case the English has: `{n, plural, other {# 张卡片}}`. Never add `one`. Where the English `one` holds a different
  sentence or a placeholder the `other` lacks (`one {Remove {agent}…}`), use `=1` for it.
- **Measure words:** cards 张 (“# 张卡片”), agents, projects, files, worktrees 个, messages and comments 条, items
  项, times 次, lines 行. Use the measure word wherever a noun is counted.
- **Placeholders:** a placeholder that holds a sentence or a status is placed after a colon (：), so it can stand on its
  own.
- **Lists:** Hive joins lists itself (“One、Two 和 Three”). Never write 和 or 或 into a message around a list
  placeholder.

## Punctuation and typography

- **Punctuation:** full-width ，。：；？！（） in Chinese text. A message that is a single label or button has no 。.
  Half-width : and () only around code, numbers or English alone (“Ctrl+K”, “(--lang)”).
- **Quotation marks:** “…”, and ‘…’ inside them. Never " in the text. A command, setting or tab named in a sentence
  goes in “” too: “设置”→“高级”，“添加智能体…”.
- **Spaces:** one half-width space between Chinese and Latin letters, numbers or a placeholder (“Claude Code 会话”,
  “5 分钟”, “智能体 {agent}”), and none next to full-width punctuation (“（{n}）”, “：{error}”). A placeholder that
  holds Chinese text (a translated phrase, a quoted mode name) takes no space (“无法加载{what}”); one that holds Latin
  text, a code or a number takes one (“以 {language} 启动”, where {language} is a code such as pl).
  A percentage, a degree or a unit stays attached to its number (“42%”).
- **Apostrophe:** Chinese has none. Before `{`, `}` or `#`, a straight apostrophe starts an ICU quotation: keep the
  English's `'{'` exactly as it is.
- **Numbers, dates, money, durations:** formatted by Hive in the Chinese way. Never write them into a message.

## Terms

The words Chinese uses for Hive's terms ([glossary.md](glossary.md)). Use them every time.

## Checking

- `npm run i18n:check` passes, and `npm run i18n:coverage` shows what is still missing or outdated.
- Look at the screenshots: `npm run e2e -- --lang zh-CN --build`, in both themes, for text that is cut off, a font
  that doesn't fall back to a Chinese one (Japanese glyph forms), or line breaks in odd places.
- A reviewer should look first at the measure words, that no plural has a `one` case, and the spaces between Chinese
  and Latin text.
