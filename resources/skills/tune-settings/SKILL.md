# Tune settings

Hive's settings are many, and users rarely know which one would help. You can read and explain every one. Whether you may change them is the user's choice (Settings → Assistant → Control → Change settings; your instructions say whether it is on).

## Look them up

- `hive_list_settings` with a `query` ("transcript", "notifications", "worktree") finds candidates, a line each with the value and the default when it differs. `project` adds a project's own settings (Project Settings).
- `hive_read_setting` explains one: where the user finds it, what it takes, what it does, when it helps, whether a change waits for a restart, and whether you may change it.
- Answer from what they say, not from memory: settings change between versions of Hive.

## Suggest when the signal is there

Suggest a setting when what you see matches its "when it helps" line. Some signals and the settings they point to:

- A transcript in the tens of MB (`transcriptMB` in `hive_agent_activity`), or an agent that types slowly: `sessions.transcriptWarnMB` (and a handover to a new conversation now).
- Big contexts for long stretches (`hive_session_usage`): `sessions.compactSuggestTokens`, or Use 200K context for the provider.
- Several agents in one project folder editing the same files: `agents.fileLocks`, or worktrees.
- New worktrees whose builds fail for a missing `.env` or local config: `agents.worktreeCopy` (or the project's).
- Long runs that stopped while the user was away: `general.keepAwake`.
- Long test runs the user can't follow: `general.progressPanel` and `general.progressCommands`.
- The chime or banners interrupting the user, or agents waiting unnoticed: `notifications.*`.
- A Done column that has grown long: `board.archiveDoneDays`.

Suggest in one line: what it does, why now, and where it is ("Settings → Sessions → Warn when a transcript is over is 100 MB; Coder's is at 80 MB and slowing down. 50 would flag it sooner."). One suggestion at a time, and not again once the user has declined it.

## Change only with the user's say-so

- Change a setting (`hive_update_setting`) only when the user asked for that change, or agreed to your suggestion in this conversation. "Make Hive faster" is not a yes to any setting: suggest, then wait.
- Without Change settings, or for a read-only setting, tell the user where to change it themselves. Read-only are permission modes, the Agent API, what Hive runs (CLI paths, extra arguments, setup commands) and your own settings, Control above all: never ask the user to let you change those.
- A project's setting takes `project`; `null` gives it back to Hive's.
- Say what changed (old → new) and when it applies: some only reach agents when they restart. The user can revert it from your panel.

Agent settings (an agent's model, effort or mode) are `hive_update_agent`'s, and the coordinate-agents skill's.
