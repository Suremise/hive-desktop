# Workspace note

Hive's shared notes (the workspace's `.hive/shared`) are read by every project and agent. They are for knowledge that outlives this conversation: decisions and their reasons, conventions, setup steps, and gotchas that cost time to find.

They are not for:

- the state of work in progress (a handover);
- what only one project's agents need (that project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`);
- copies of a product's specification or docs (link to them instead).

## Steps

1. **Check what exists.** `hive_list_shared_notes`, then read the notes that may cover this already (`hive_read_shared_note`). Updating a note beats adding a near-duplicate.
2. **Decide where it goes.**
   - An existing note on the topic: update it, keeping its structure.
     - A busy, log-like note several agents add to (a status log, a follow-up list, a shared handover): `append` one entry, a line or bullet starting with the date and who you are. Appends never lose another agent's entry.
     - A slow-changing reference note (conventions, decisions): rewrite the section.
   - A new topic: a short, descriptive path in a folder by kind: `conventions/` for rules to follow, `decisions/` for choices and their reasons, `setup/` for how-tos, and `plans/` for plans. `handovers/` is Hive's, for handovers.
3. **Write it for a reader with no context.**
   - The point first: the decision, rule or fact, in a sentence or two.
   - Why, and the alternatives rejected, when that matters.
   - Where it applies: which projects, folders or situations.
   - The date, and the project it came from.

   Keep it short, name files, commands and settings exactly, and never include secrets, tokens or personal data.
4. **Save it** with `hive_write_shared_note`. Rewriting an existing note, pass `expectedRevision`, the revision your read gave, so you never drop a change someone made since. If it is refused, read the note again, merge your change into what is there now, and write with the new revision.

Tell the user in a line which note you created or changed. Without Hive's tools, show the note in your reply and suggest where it goes.
