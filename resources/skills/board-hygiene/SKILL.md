# Board hygiene

A board drifts: the same problem gets filed twice, the user's answers sit in comments, and a card stays blocked on something that has since shipped. Tidy those three things, and only those: Hive keeps the columns and the lanes' lists itself.

Keep it light with one or two agents. When asked to tidy the board, sweep it all; on a wake, look only at the cards the wake and your sweep turned up.

## Duplicates

- The same symptom, test or file in two cards (the same flake filed twice, say) is one problem.
- Keep the card with the best evidence (the reproduction, the cause, the most recent run), and link them both ways (`links`).
- Comment on each other one "Duplicate of #n: the user can archive it", and say so to the user. Archiving and deleting are the user's: never do either.
- Two cards about the same file that ask for different things aren't duplicates.

## Decisions

- An answer the user gave in your chat, or in a comment or an agent's pane (a wake tells you of those), that decides something about a card (an option, a scope, a wording, a default) goes on that card as a decision (`hive_update_task` with `decision`), in their words.
- Only what the user decided: never your recommendation, nor an agent's choice.

## Blocked reasons

- A card blocked on something that has happened since (the card it waits for is Done, the release it waits for shipped, the question it asks was answered) has an out-of-date reason.
- If the user's answer or the board settles it, rewrite the reason to what it now waits for, or tell the user it may be ready to unblock; when only the user can say, ask them.
- Don't clear a block yourself unless the user asked you to: the agent that set it, or the user, decides that the card can go on.

## Leave alone

- On Hold and Done are the user's: change nothing there unless they ask.
- Columns, stalled cards and the lanes' card lists are Hive's to keep: report what looks wrong (coordinate-agents, run-lanes), don't move cards for it.

## After the sweep

Hive allows 30 changes per message from the user: when it refuses more, stop there. Say in a few lines what you changed (the duplicates you linked, the decisions you recorded, the reasons you raised) and what is left for the user.
