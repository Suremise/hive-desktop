# Split work

Produce a plan the user (or the Hive Assistant, if the user asks it to) can act on. Don't start agents or the work yourself.

## First: does splitting help?

Splitting costs coordination and, with worktrees, a merge. It helps when the task has parts that can go ahead independently and each is big enough to be worth an agent. If the work is small, or every part touches the same few files, say so and suggest one agent. Don't invent tiny parts to fill agents.

## Steps

1. **Understand the task.** Read the request and the code it touches. Ask the user when the goal or the boundaries are unclear.
2. **Find the seams.** Look for parts with a clear goal, a set of files they own, and few dependencies on the others: separate modules, layers (API, UI, tests, docs) or features.
3. **Order what can't be parallel.** Shared foundations (a type, an interface, a schema, a helper) land first, by one agent, before the others build on them.
4. **Choose where each part works.** Agents in the project folder share its files: Hive's file locks make one wait while another edits a file. An agent in its own worktree works on a separate branch, merged back later. Use the project folder for small or tightly connected parts, or parts that touch different files anyway. Use a worktree for larger or riskier parts, experiments, or parts that must change files another part also changes. `hive_project_status` shows the project's agents and their worktrees.
5. **Plan the integration.** Say in what order the parts merge, and how the whole is checked at the end (often a review with the review-agent-work skill).

## The plan

For each part:

- **Name** and a one-line goal.
- **Owns**: the files or folders only it changes.
- **Reads**: what it depends on but doesn't change.
- **Where**: project folder or worktree, and why.
- **After**: parts that must land first.
- **Done when**: how to tell (checks pass, behaviour works).
- **Brief**: a self-contained prompt for its agent, which sees nothing else.

## Keeping it

When the plan should outlive this conversation, save it with `hive_write_shared_note` under `plans/` (for example `plans/2026-10-03-auth-refactor.md`), so any agent in any worktree can read it. When the user wants it on the board, each part can become a card (`hive_create_task`, with `blockedBy` for the order). Otherwise give the plan in your reply.
